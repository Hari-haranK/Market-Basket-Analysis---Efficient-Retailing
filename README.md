# Market Basket Analysis Using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project applies Market Basket Analysis techniques using machine learning to uncover patterns and associations between products in retail transactions. It uses the Apriori algorithm to analyze transaction data and generate association rules that help optimize sales and marketing strategies.  

## Features  
- Automated analysis of transaction data to find product relationships.  
- Enhances marketing strategies through cross-selling and up-selling.  
- Improves product placement decisions in stores and online platforms.  
- Scalable to large datasets using machine learning algorithms.  

## Project Architecture  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis.  
- **Frequent Itemset Mining:** Uses the Apriori algorithm to identify frequently purchased itemsets.  
- **Association Rule Generation:** Derives meaningful relationships between items from frequent itemsets.  

## System Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning  
- Apriori package for association rule mining  

## Installation and Setup  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hari-haranK/Market-Basket-Analysis-ML.git
   cd Market-Basket-Analysis-ML
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy mlxtend seaborn matplotlib  
   ```  
3. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python market_basket_analysis.py
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Load the dataset containing retail transaction data.  
2. Apply preprocessing to clean and structure the data.  
3. Use the Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets.  
4. Derive association rules from frequent itemsets.  
5. Analyze the results to optimize sales strategies.  

## Algorithm Used  
- **Apriori Algorithm:** Identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules.  
- **Association Rule Learning:** Extracts strong relationships between different products.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Integration with real-time retail systems for on-the-fly recommendations.  
- Application of advanced machine learning models for sales prediction and forecasting.  
- Expansion to handle larger and more complex datasets.
